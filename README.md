# Uhealth+

## 💡 Inspiration

We got inspired from the research we did for the project and found that there was no good website with curing diseases, connecting patients and doctors, with decentralised chat to communicate with the doctors. We decided to go for this project.

## 💻 What it does

Uhealth+ is aweb application that allows you to:

- Locate nearest hospitals to you
- Book an appointment with a doctor
- List different diseases and their symptoms
- Chat anonymously with doctors with reveling your identity
- A smart chatbot that will help you find the best doctor for you
